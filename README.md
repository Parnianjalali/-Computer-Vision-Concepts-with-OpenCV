## ðŸ“Œ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple parts. Each part covers a set of concepts in Computer Vision.  

### âœ… Part 1 â€“ Basics of Image Processing
- Reading and displaying images  
- Color channels (splitting and merging)  
- Color spaces (RGB, BGR, HSV, Alpha/transparency)  
- Image arithmetic (`cv.add`, `cv.addWeighted`)  
- Drawing shapes (rectangles, polygons)  
- Brightness and contrast (linear correction, gamma correction)  
- Histograms of pixel intensities  

### ðŸŸ¦ Part 2 â€“ Interactive Drawing and Real-Time Video
- Mouse events and interactive drawing (circles, rectangles, freehand brush)  
- Undo functionality and live previews for drawing  
- Changing colors with keyboard input  
- Trackbars for interactive parameter adjustment (blending, color channels)  
- Capturing live video from webcam  
- Saving webcam video to a file  
- Screen capture and capturing a region of the screen
